		<h1>Being User-Centric</h1>
		<h3>How to ensure users can fully utilise the service</h3>
	</div>

		Through a study conducted by the Nielsen Norman Group<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/"> [1]</a></sup> it has become apparant that although the technology for highly sophisticated web interfaces is here, the overwhelming majority of users are unable to interact with even the most basic interfaces. Evidence shows that for your website to serve the largest amount of users it must be very simplistic and often-times requires the removal of high-level features.

	<h1>Average User Skill Distribution</h1>
	<p>
	Through the study<sup>[1]</sup>, we can make the determination that 25% of the Adult population are unable to even use a computer, further to this a cumulative 43% of users are only capable of very basic tasks. So we must assume that 68% of all end-users are incapable of solving any problems should they arise and should be supplied with the simplest site presentation possible.  There are certain exceptions to this as it is assumed that those who find their way to a topic-specific site such as this Web Development site possess the basic knowledge needed else they would not have sought it out - but the issue still remains that we must still assume that the vast majority of service users are, on a functional level, technologically illiterate.

	<h1>Essential design practices for accessiblity</h1>
	<p>
	The first thing to consider is <em>Learnability</em>; this is to say how easy it is for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they visit your site. Can they immediately find the required page or is there a learning curve to your navigation. If there is then you may want to rethink how you approach this.</br></br>
	The second is <em>Learnability</em>; how quickly can they accomplish their goals? This is typically in reference to those who have prior use of your site - how quickly can they naviagate back to a page they once found and want to revisit? </br></br>
	A third is <em>Satisfaction</em>; how pleasing is it to use the design? Would the user be likely to enjoy using your service, or do you feel that it's implementation is mundane and boring? Don't forget - as there are so many websites, you need to differentiate!
