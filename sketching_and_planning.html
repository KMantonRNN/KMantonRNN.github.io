		Developing a website can be difficult at the best of times, however creating one adhoc with no plan will only lead to difficulties down the road. Good design practice shows that you should first sketch out a basic <em>wireframe</em> so you can construct with website the better flow. If you first draw an outline of the site you will know how many elements you require, how they should be arranged and how you will implement this. Further, if you have multiple of the same element it will help with naming schemes during construction as you will know what requires the same styles. This will reduce time spent creating and also any time spent altering the site to meet any additional conditions.

	<h1>Step 1</h1>
	<p>
	First you should establish the requirements of the site. This is either from your client/design document or your own design; you should then write these down in indivual html elements. Elements such as images, articles and other. Global elements are also very important as they are likely to situated in the same area throughout your site such as a navigation bar.

	<h1>Step 2</h1>
	<p>
	It is a good idea at this point to label any elements with their intended names; classes and id's are helpful to have on paper as a reference point. At this point you should have a full wireframe, labelled elements and can begin to style them. Basic styling notes like "colourful" or "header" can be useful when it comes to CSS

<div id="SP3">
	<h1>Step 3</h1>
	<p>
	Due to the nature of html and CSS processing, elements above are rendered first so it is a good idea to begin working from the top of your document otherwise positioning elements will be almost impossible. Further to this you should pay attention to how you are arranging your elements and whether it is worth the time it would take to position it in such a manner or if you should rearrange the site slightly.

<div id="SP4">
	<h1>Step 4</h1>
	<p>
	Populate your wireframes with dummy content so you can visualise what it will look like when feature complete. Good practice shows that <a class="inlinehref" href="https://www.lipsum.com/">'Lorum Ipsum'</a> text is best to represent populated text boxes. It accurately represents the finished product and can help with element sizing and font styling.
