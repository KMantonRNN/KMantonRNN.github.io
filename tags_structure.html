			Here we will detail the very basic HTML tags including the basic required tags for all webpages and a few quality of life inclusions; these include commenting and naming conventions for widespread accesibility to all future developers. This is a very important concept in web design - code must be legible to people other than yourself. Therefore code must be either self-documenting, wherein the existence of elements and their names denote their function (eg using "navBar" instead of "element2") or documented. To document we use comments shown below.

This is a basic design for a webpage

It includes &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; to denote it is a html document 
and also includes the other main tags present in every webpage

Notice that all tags open with &lt;&gt; and close with &lt;/&gt;
This is how html represents single elements and they function
just like parenthesis do in a written language. 

Each bracket must be closed somewhere however you can
nest brackets within each other

There are several good practices to html coding, and coding in general
Here we see the example syntax of a comment; this is used so the developer can document their code
and also so that it is not rendered in the final page.

Since html automatically detects brackets in it's code as special elements
it can be difficult to display them in general written use.
Therefore we use &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; to show brackets

Also there is the different uses of ID and CLASS elements.
I will further explore their usefulness in the CSS/HTML parts of this guide
however as good practice it is generally recommended that IDs are only used on one element
and classes are used on multiple elements.
Also, you should follow this naming structure "lowercaseUppercase" for ease of reading/referencing
